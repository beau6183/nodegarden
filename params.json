No Barnes-Hut n-body optimization, just [simple physics](https://github.com/pakastin/nodegarden/blob/master/scripts/index.js#L115).\r\n\r\n- Circles represent nodes\r\n- Node's mass is proportional to it's size\r\n- Lines visualize the gravitational force between nodes\r\n- Line opacity equals to the strength of force\r\n- When two nodes collide, smaller one will reset to a new location and size\r\n- When node travels over screen limits it will reset to a new location and size\r\n\r\nAlso check out my other projects: https://deck-of-cards.js.org and https://frzr.js.org\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
